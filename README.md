🔥 Calories Burnt Prediction Using Machine Learning
📋 Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts the number of calories burnt during physical activities using Machine Learning models. It uses user-specific data such as gender, age, height, weight, exercise duration, heart rate, and body temperature to provide accurate predictions.

Developed in Python with pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Streamlit, the app offers an interactive and user-friendly experience for fitness tracking and awareness.
